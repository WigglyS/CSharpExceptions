# CSharpExceptions
The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with exceptions and exception handling in C#.  You will modify your simple employee payroll program. Your Address, Person, and Employee classes should throw appropriate exceptions when misused (i.e. if an attempt is made to pass a negative value in to the wage property). Also, your client code (the code that uses your classes) should be prepared to catch any and all exceptions that might be thrown by your classes or other classes.
